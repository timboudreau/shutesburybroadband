Shutesbury Broadband FAQ
------------------------

This is a *draft* document.  See the town website for the official version.  All statements herein should be construed as speculative.

### Overview

This document exists to answer questions about broadband in Shutesbury.  If something is missing, wrong or could be phrased better [file a bug](https://github.com/timboudreau/shutesburybroadband/issues) or follow the [instructions for making changes](https://github.com/timboudreau/shutesburybroadband).

Telephone and cable companies have teased Shutesbury with the promise of broadband (high speed internet) access for nearly 20 years, but nobody has delivered - some streets in town have wired internet via DSL, a slow, obsolete technology built on deteriorating electronics. We believe it is time to - intelligently - build for Shutesbury what the private market did not - and has no plans to - build.

As a result of Massachusetts Broadband Initiative's recent "middle mile" project, there is now a fiber optic connection at the town hall which has sufficient bandwidth capacity to supply the entire town with internet at speeds far faster than *anything* currently available.  Fiber optic equipment is upgradeable, so we are talking about a future-proof network.  At a fundamental level, it is based on the physics of light passing through a piece of glass, split into different frequencies carrying different people's data.  Future advances come from splitting light more finely; the physics of light passing through glass do not change.  So an investment in a fiber optic network is an investment that will not be obsolete in 10, 20 or even 30 years.

The Shutesbury Broadband Committee is currently considering plans to connect all homes in town to the internet via fiber-optic cable. At this point, there are different options to consider. There is likely to be money available from the state to help pay for some, but not all of the expenses required.

The following details some of what is required to establish a town-side fiber-optic network. Building a network is a multi-step infrastructure project that involves a number of tasks:

 - Conducting an inventory of telephone poles in town, road-miles and number of households and lots that are likely to be built on, in order to do accurate cost estimates - the Shutesbury Broadband Committee is organizing a volunteer effort for this in late October 2014
 - Make-ready work (moving existing wires) by Verizon and National Grid to make room for fiber optic cable on some of the poles in town
 - Fiber optic cable run between poles in town
 - Fiber optic cable run from telephone poles to houses
 - Setting up the infrastructure for managing the network (switches in a small building or location in town hall)
 - Interfacing with the Massachusetts Broadband Initiative (MBI) - a quasi-private organization which is providing the "middle mile" fiber-optic link to Town Hall already, to provide bandwidth for resale to consumers, and manages grants from the state to build "last mile" networks
 - Contracting a local ISP (Internet Service Provider) to manage the network

Some of these steps can be done in parallel;  most of them cannot be done until the town can prove they will be paid for.  A number of these steps require the town's Municipal Lighting Plant (MLP) to issue a formal Request for Proposals and collect bids to do the work (a few years back, the town voted to establish the necessary Municipal Light and Power entity that will function on behalf of Shutesbury residents).

There may be grants available from the state which can help defray the costs, but it is unlikely that they will cover the entire cost of building the network - meaning the town will likely need to raise a bond to do that work.  The costs of the work may be recovered through subscriber fees in the future, but there are upfront costs for the labor and infrastructure.

Part of what the broadband committee is doing is making sure we (and you!) are fully informed about our options in building the network, so that we build something that will work, last, and not cost any more than it has to.  Any plan we adopt will be prudent financially and will minimize costs.


### Why Broadband

There are [many documents](http://muninetworks.org/content/frequently-asked-questions#ownership) that do an excellent job of explaining the value to a community of broadband internet, so we will keep this section short.

Broadband internet creates opportunities for people in Shutesbury that do not currently exist.  Specifically, it

 - Makes work-from-home jobs that require an internet connection available to Shutesbury residents whom it is not currently an option for
 - Allows modern school curricula to be implemented, which assume students have internet access
 - Allows Shutesbury residents to start internet-based businesses
 - Connects Shutesbury residents to the rest of the world in a way they are not now
 - Increases the value of our homes - many home buyers will not consider a property that does not have broadband
 - Makes quality-of-life enhancing services such as [Telehelp](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7694919) available to citizens of Shutesbury


### The Situation Today

At the moment, a handful of households in Shutesbury have broadband internet via Verizon DSL, which is slow when compared with the options in nearby towns;  some households pay high rates for satellite-based internet, which is fast but suffers from high latency and outages during bad weather.  Some parts of town have cellular phone service and can use that, usually with limited data plans, and also subject to weather-related outages.

Over the last 20 years, various companies have hinted at or even promised to deliver broadband internet to Shutesbury.  None of them have done so, and there is little reason to - Shutesbury has relatively few households and low population density.  Because it abuts the Quabbin Reservoir, Shutesbury is not on the way to any place with more potential customers.  So the return on investment for commercial internet access is not there.

We believe an investment in broadband internet access in Shutesbury can pay for itself, but on a 20-30 year time horizon - the kind of investment government can make, but which businesses that need to produce shorter-term profits for shareholders cannot.  The private market has had more than twenty years to solve this problem in Shutesbury.  It has not.

There is almost certain to be funding available from the state to defray the costs if we do this in the near future - the recent [IT bond bill](http://www.mma.org/economic-a-community-development/13518-it-bond-bills-passed-by-house-senate-would-fund-high-speed-internet-in-rural-areas) means that funds will be available if we act very soon, making this a good time to invest in broadband in Shutesbury.

Our neighboring town, Leverett, is mid-way through installing such a network, and we have the ability to learn from their experience.

Shutesbury is a member of the cooperative WiredWest, a non-profit coalition of "municipal lighting plants" of towns in Western Massachusetts.  A municipal lighting plant (MLP) is a legal entity belonging to the town which is allowed by law to provide telecommunications services such as telephone and internet.


## Entities And Terminology

 * **Municipal Lighting Plant (MLP)** - A legal entity under [Chapter 164 of Massachusetts General Laws](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter164/Section47E), which belongs to the town and can deliver telecommunications services, which includes internet service.  Shutesbury has one.

 * [**Wired West**](http://wiredwest.net/) is a cooperative of 40+ towns - specifically, it's a cooperative for 40+ municipal lighting plants - in Western Massachusetts which are working together to bring broadband to all 40+ communities.  Shutesbury has the option of building this network as part of a *regional network* administered by WiredWest, or taking Leverett's approach of simply building its own network.

 * [**Massachusetts Broadband Initiative (MBI)**](http://broadband.masstech.org/) - The quasi private organization which built the fiber network that runs to the center of town.  MBI is funded by state and federal grants.  Originally it was chartered to build the entire network to wire homes in Western Massachusetts.  After its funding was cut in half, it has focused on the "middle mile" - getting fiber to towns, so that they can build the "last mile" to residences.
    * MBI is administering the recent $50,000,000 grant from the state to build out "last-mile" networks to homes in Western MA

 * [**Axia**](http://www.axia.com/) - Axia is the company contracted by MBI to administer the "middle mile" network;  assuming we use MBI's network (which is currently the only option), the network we build would be reselling bandwidth bought in bulk from Axia.  Axia's business model depends on selling bandwidth to businesses;  our understanding is that currently commercial uptake has been lower than desired, which may affect rates.  Axia is not permitted to sell bandwidth delivered by the "middle mile" network directly to consumers;  a local ISP must act as a reseller.

 * [**Point of Presence (POP)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence) - the place where fiber optic lines to households connect to the cable that runs out of town and connects to the wider internet

 * [**Request For Proposals (RFP)**](http://www.mass.gov/hed/housing/ph-mod/bidding-and-rfp-information.html) - The formal process by which a town requests bids from contractors to do work

 * **Last Mile** - term used to refer to connections between a point of presence and individual households - the last leg of a network

 * **Middle Mile** - the set of fiber optic cables that connect points of presence in towns with the internet backbone

 * **Take Rate** - the percentage of households in an area with a network who actually subscribe to use the network.  Having an accurate estimate of this is important, to be able to predict how long it will take a network to pay for itself when attempting to secure financing.

 * **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** - a company which is responsible for managing a network, billing for its use, fixing things that go wrong and providing customer support to subscribers on that network.  For example, Leverett has contracted [Crocker Communications](http://www.crocker.com/) to run their network.

 * **Backhaul Network** - The connection that connects a local network to the wider world of the internet - the same way a WIFI box connects computers to the network it is physically plugged in to 

 * [**Active Ethernet**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x#Optical_distribution_networks) - an option for type of network, which utilizes separate connections to the backhaul for each household

 * [**Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network) - another of our options for type of network, which uses passive splitters to connect a smaller number of fibers to the backhaul network

 * **Latency** - the time it takes for data to reach a destination, independent of the speed of travel. Satellite internet suffers from high latency.  Think of it this way:  You are standing in a field a mile from your friend, who has a very powerful fire-hose aimed at you.  When you say so, your friend turns on the water.  Once the water arrives, it will be moving very fast - but you still will wait a while before it shows up, while the water is travelling through the air.  That delay is the *latency* - and is the same phenomenon seen with satellite internet - you click a link, and after some latency, the page seems to arrive all at once.


### Dependencies

Some parts of the work can be done in parallel - for example, pole applications can be done on a "rolling" basis as the work is being done.  Other things - particularly funding-dependent things can only be done once money to pay for them is available.  In particular:

 - Funding must be available for pole applications in order to make them - that means grants must be received and any additional funds needed must be available at the time they are done
 - Pole applications cost money and have a time-out - so the network design dictates the number and order of pole applications.  So, funding precedes network design;  network design precedes pole applications;  pole applications precede work to add fiber-optic cable to poles


### Wired West Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

 - Local residents who lived near Granby, MA in the past may remember that Granby had its own phone company;  the punishment for that from national phone companies was that all calls to or from Granby were long-distance and expensive.  A regional network has more resources to fight back against attempts by commercial service providers to squeeze or penalize subscribers.
 - An organization representing 40+ towns has an economy of scale - it is in a better position to negotiate discounts on things like network design and other labor - so it can potentially save towns money
 - Funding is less risky since WiredWest pools funding across all member towns for which it is building networks
 - Costs of damage to infrastructure from storms, such as the [ice-storm of '08](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2008_New_England_and_Upstate_New_York_ice_storm), are amortized across all member towns - we're in it together

**Cons:**

 - Coordinating work across 45 towns is far more complex than coordinating work in one
 - WiredWest has finite resources and there is no guarantee that Shutesbury's needs will not wind up behind other towns in the queue of networks to be built, so getting broadband may take longer
 - WiredWest has existed for several years, but has not yet built a network in *any* town, so it has no track-record
 - The funding mechanism is more complicated, since, for WiredWest to build a network the town likely must raise a bond, and lend or transfer that money to WiredWest.

The decision of whether to go with WiredWest or not is one the selectboard will make, based on input from the broadband committee, their own investigation of the available options and assessment of the liklihood of success.

Much of the work to be done is identical whether or not the town opts to cast its lot with WiredWest - the same work needs to be done either way - so it is not necessary to answer this question immediately.


### Funding Model
The funding model for building the network is one of the things to be determined.  In broad strokes, what "funding model" means is

 * How do funds from the town and grant moneys find their way to the legal entity building the network (a town can't just lend money to a third party because it feels like it;  one proposed mechanism to do that legally is based on [Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 44, Section 8](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter44/Section8))
 * Where tax dollars are used, is it
    * A loan, which will be paid back to the town out of subscriber fees over a period of years, or
    * Simply the town paying for infrastructure to be built

This dovetails with the WiredWest question, since the legal rules that govern how it works are likely to be different.

A major question is whether the network should "pay for itself" - meaning 
 * The town raises a bond and lends that money to the entity building the network, and that gets paid back out of subscriber fees, versus
 * The town raises a bond and pays for the network to be built, period

A funding model where the network pays for itself is likely to be more politically popular, and means that, in the long run, only the people who use the network are the ones who pay for it (in the form of higher subscriber fees).  However, in the case that very few people actually buy service, that is higher risk - the entity operating the network would need subscriber fees to cover both loan payments *and* maintenance costs.

The broadband committee is leaning toward the "pays for itself" model, because that is likely to be less controversial.

We plan to have an accountant run some actual numbers, and present some concrete projections of the impact of different funding models on loan repayment, subscriber rates and so forth on this page soon.


Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Will Anybody Be Left Out?**
This will be partly funded from tax dollars, and it is only fair that if your taxes help to pay for it, that you should benefit from it.  Nobody will be left out.  You can choose whether or not to sign up for service, but if you live in Shutesbury, the connection will be there for you.

**How Soon Will I Have Broadband?**
Any estimates are conjecture at this point, but the *best-case* scenario at the date of this writing (September, 2014) is two years from now, probably a bit longer.

**How Much Will The Subscriber Fees Be?**
Any number is speculative at this point, but we believe it will be in the $50/$75 month range for both basic internet *and* phone service.  For most people, that will be less than they are paying now.

**Will My Taxes Go Up?**
While we cannot at this time specify exact numbers, the expectation is that it will go up by less than $300 per household per year or $25/month, as a result of issuing a bond of similar size to the one Leverett did.

If all homes are connected (as opposed to "fiber to the curb") then property tax rates should be unaffected.  The value of your home, if you sell it, goes up.  But the value of your home *relative to the value of your neighbors' homes* does not change (theirs go up by the same percentage), and the difference between valuations is what drives changes in property tax amounts for individual properties.

**Who Will Pay For Building The Network?**
There are a variety of grants and sources of grants available - most notably, the $50,000,000 in the recent IT bond bill.  That money is currently *authorized* for MBI - meaning MBI will be issuing grants to individual towns' MLPs or entities such as WiredWest.  The money is not yet *appropriated* - meaning that MBI does not actually have it yet - it's still working its way through the system to them.

Realistically, the town will very likely have to raise a bond to cover some of the work.

**Will The Town Vote On Whether Or Not To Build A Fiber Optic Network?**
At some point we need to start doing the parts of this that cost money, which may require a "debt exclusion override" vote - essentially the town votes to exclude the debt from counting toward the limitations placed on it by [Proposition 2 1/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_2%C2%BD).  At present, the earliest that is likely to happen is the April 2015 town meeting.

The town must borrow the money to pay the upfront costs of building the network.

**Can I keep my existing Verizon phone / DSL service?**
Yes.  You are under no obligation to use the service.

**What Parts Of This Cost Money?**
Building the network involves paying for

 - Doing a network design - i.e. where will the fiber run, what splitters or other equipment is needed where.  The design is also a prerequisite for making detailed cost estimates.
 - A project manager or project management company to coordinate and schedule the work, ensure contractors are paid, ensure work is completed on-time and correctly, and be responsible for the details of the project
 - "Pole applications" to Verizon and National Grid, to apply to add fiber to telephone poles;  each application can be for up to 200 poles;  the application fees are applicable to the labor of putting the fiber up later.
 - Labor to actually install the fiber on poles and connect homes

**What Parts Of This Involve A *Request For Proposals (RFP)* and competitive bidding process?**

 - The network design
 - Building the network
 - Management of the resulting network

**Who Will Own The Resulting Infrastructure/Network?**
The town itself will own the network.  The management of it will likely be contracted out to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with experience managing such networks.  If we go with WiredWest, WiredWest might either *be* the ISP, or contract one.

If a third-party wound up owning the network, that third-party could go bankrupt and sell infrastructure paid for by you to a telco or similar company.  We do not want that to be possible, so we are endeavoring to avoid any situation where that could be the outcome.

**Why Connect Houses, Why Not Fiber To The Curb?** 
Fiber to the curb decreases the upfront costs of the network by about 1/3, but means that the network will initially have no subscribers. Lenders see a network with no built-in subscribers as a worse investment, meaning a higher cost of borrowing.  It also means that each homeowner would need to pay $1000-$2000 to connect their home.  And it means that the taxes on the houses that do connect will go up, since it increases their relative value.

Fiber to every house means that the value of everyone's home increases across the board - that means no relative change in value (your house is worth more, but so is everybody else's), and so no tax increase simply because you got connected.

We recommend fiber to the home, not just the curb.  If it proves impossible to find funding for fiber-to-the-home, but to-the-curb is within financial reach, then it may be considered.

**Why Are We Doing A Pole Inventory? Doesn't Verizon or National Grid Have This Information?**
Yes they do and they will not give it to us.  A town doing broadband on its own is seen as competition.  They are obligated to hang fiber on the poles if we apply for the work and pay for it to be done, but they are not doing us any favors.

The utility companies own the telephone poles in town;  the town does not.  If you want to add or change something on those poles, you are asking to do something to *their* property.  A "pole application" to do work on one to two hundred poles costs $10,000 - that money gets applied later to pay for the labor to put up the fiber cables.  One mistake on such an application and they can reject it and charge us another $10,000 to apply again.  So we need to have a detailed inventory, and it needs to be 100% correct.  The only guaranteed-reliable way to have this information is to go and get it ourselves.


**Can I Volunteer To Help With The Pole Inventory?**
Yes!  It is happening on Saturday of the last weekend in October 2014 (rain date the first weekend of November).  Apply on the [mailing list via the town website](http://www.shutesbury.org/broadband).


**Are we doing GPON or Active Ethernet?**
That is not decided at present, but the broadband committee has been leaning in the direction of recommending GPON.  The difference between the two is this:

 - With active ethernet, there is one fiber that runs from each home all the way to the "Point of Presence" (POP) (the connection that brings internet traffic to and from town) - everybody gets their own fiber
 - With GPON, the design looks like hubs and spokes - there are passive splitters, and the network fans out from various points

GPON costs about 1/3 less than Active Ethernet, owing to it requiring fewer fibers and thus smaller cables attached to poles;  since the cables weigh less, they are less prone to breakage and therefore cheaper to maintain.

GPON is the cheaper option (many homes' signals are multiplexed on fewer cables);  active ethernet can potentially deliver more bandwidth.  Google Fiber and many university campuses use GPON for their networks successfully, and it appears to be the direction the industry is going.

There is a lot of advocacy on the internet of both solutions, frequently from parties that have a financial interest in one or the other.  The decision is similar to choosing VHS versus Beta (two competing video tape standards in the 1980s).  Looking at what companies that build networks are actually *doing*, it appears that GPON is more common - which suggests that maintenance and equipment upgrades for GPON networks will be cheaper in the long-term.  Here is a link to [one discussion of the choices](http://www.geekzone.co.nz/forums.asp?topicid=58040) from New Zealand, which has been rolling out fiber in recent years.

A final decision on this has not been made yet.

**What About Wireless?**
Wireless internet is *line of sight*, is affected by weather, and is far slower than fiber-optic networking.  In a hilly town like Shutesbury, at best, it could be made to serve some small areas of town.

Please read [this article](http://muninetworks.org/content/wireless) for a clear and cogent explanation of why wireless networking is not a realistic solution to bring broadband to all of Shutesbury.

Wireless is an option for densely populated, flat, relatively unobstructed areas.  It is not practical for Shutesbury.

**What Are Some Of The Costs Involved?**
All costs here are estimates:

 - Total cost per household for doing a similar project in Leverett:  $5000 per household
 - Cost of the network build in Leverett:  $2.6 million (Shutesbury is geographically bigger)
 - Cost of running fiber to one telephone pole:  $300
 - Cost of the network design for Leverett (Shutesbury should be comparable): $40,000
 - Cost of an application to Verizon:  $10,000 per 200 poles (the money is applied to work done later)
